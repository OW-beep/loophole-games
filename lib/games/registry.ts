      'Most merge puzzles only ask you to think one move ahead. Echo Merge asks you to think one move ahead twice — once for the tile you\u2019re moving now, and once for the echo it will trigger on your next turn. The idea started from a simple question: what if a puzzle\u2019s hardest opponent was a slightly-delayed copy of your own decisions?',

    designNotes: [
      "The original Mirror Loop showed the full beam path, which turned it into a visual scanning task rather than a reasoning one. This version makes two changes: each lane now has two mirrors in sequence, and the beam disappears after hitting its first mirror so you can't just follow it to the answer.",
      'Because the rotation budget equals exactly the number of wrongly-set mirrors, every wasted rotation on a mirror that didn\u2019t need changing is a rotation you can\u2019t get back. The puzzle is partly about correctly diagnosing the problem before you act.',

    strategyTips: [
      "The visible half of each beam \u2014 from the emitter to the first mirror \u2014 tells you whether the first mirror's angle is roughly right. Use that to narrow down which mirrors are definitely wrong before spending a rotation.",
      "A target that's already lit means that entire beam is solved. Don't touch those mirrors, even if you're not sure why they're working.",

    designNotes: [
      'Match-3 games usually reward you for finding the biggest combo on the board. Color Debt asks a different question: what if your biggest combo was also your biggest liability? Every match spawns debt tiles roughly proportional to its size, so a flashy five-in-a-row leaves a bigger mess behind than a clean three-in-a-row.',
      'Debt tiles aren\u2019t inherently bad — they convert back into normal color tiles for free the moment a match happens next to them. The tension is entirely about timing: debt left untouched for three turns locks permanently into a Bad Tile, which never moves and never clears, slowly shrinking your usable board.',

    strategyTips: [

    designNotes: [
      'Word games almost always present letters in a fixed grid and ask you to find words within it. Gravity Word makes the grid itself unstable: every flip physically rearranges which letters sit next to which, so the same sixteen-odd letters can spell completely different words depending on which way you tilt the board.',
      'New letters only enter from the edge directly opposite the direction you just set, which means gravity isn\u2019t just a way to move letters around — it\u2019s also the only way new letters get into play. Every flip is simultaneously a search for existing words and a decision about what comes in next.',
    ],
    strategyTips: [
      'Scan for short, common words first (3–4 letters) rather than holding out for a long one — clearing small words faster keeps new letters flowing in, which gives you more shots at bigger words later.',
      'Pay attention to which edge refills after each flip. If you need a specific letter, flipping gravity away from that edge is how you\u2019ll eventually draw a fresh one there.',

      'Tap any point between two cells to fold the strip there. The shorter side always folds onto the longer side — that\u2019s just how paper works.',

      'Keep folding to shrink the strip down to a single cell.',
      'You win when that final cell matches the target number, with folds left to spare.',
    ],
    designNotes: [
      'Most number-merging puzzles ask you to combine pieces side by side. Fold asks what happens if the combining motion is a literal fold — the geometry of paper-folding means you don\u2019t get to choose which two cells touch independently of each other; an entire side of the strip moves at once.',
      'Because the shorter flap always folds onto the longer base, every fold is irreversible in a specific, physical way: you can\u2019t un-crease paper. Reaching the target is really a question of choosing your crease points in the right order.',
    ],
    strategyTips: [
      'Folding near the middle shrinks the strip fastest, but folding near an edge lets you control exactly which two cells combine first — sometimes a slow, precise fold beats a fast, blunt one.',
      'Work out roughly what the last one or two cells need to sum to before you commit to your final folds — it\u2019s easy to overshoot the target in the last move.',

    designNotes: [
      'Carry Chain started from a question about 2048-style merging games: what if the act of combining two things always left a small side effect on something else nearby? The "+1 to your neighbor" rule means every merge is doing two things at once — simplifying the row, and quietly inflating the total.',
      'Because a carry that lands on the rightmost edge is wasted, where you merge matters just as much as what you merge. The same two numbers merged in a different position can produce a different total by the end of the puzzle.',
    ],
    strategyTips: [
      'Track the running total, not just the tile values — the target is about the whole row\u2019s sum, not any single tile.',
      'Merging near the right edge of the row wastes the carry. If you need every point you can get, merge further left.',

    designNotes: [
      'Brace Yard came from a simple observation: a support requirement like this is almost always satisfiable if you ship the whole yard eventually — there\u2019s always some safe order. The real tension only shows up once you can\u2019t ship everything. With just ten shipments out of twenty-five crates, you have to deliberately choose the high-value ones, and the heaviest crates tend to depend on each other for support.',
      'That last part is the trap: ship one heavy crate too early, and you may have just removed the only thing holding up its heavy neighbor.',
    ],
    strategyTips: [
      'Going purely for the single heaviest crate available, over and over, performs surprisingly well — but watch what it leaves unsupported behind it.',
      'Two heavy crates that neighbor each other are often safer shipped back-to-back than spread apart, before something else erodes their mutual support.',

      'Splice is built on a simple mathematical fact: swapping the same stretch twice undoes itself completely. That made it possible to generate a guaranteed-solvable puzzle by starting from a solved board and scrambling it with a few splices — the puzzle is fair by construction, not by luck.',
      'The mechanic is closer to genome-rearrangement problems in computational biology than to anything in a typical puzzle catalog — you\u2019re not matching or merging, you\u2019re sorting two interleaved sequences using only block swaps.',

      'Scan for the longest stretch where every number in the top strand is already \u2264 8 or every number in the bottom strand is already \u2265 9 — those sections don\u2019t need touching.',
      'A single splice can fix several misplaced numbers at once if you pick the range carefully, rather than splicing one column at a time.',
